M5Cardputer MP3 Player 🎵A fully featured, standalone MP3 player designed specifically for the M5Stack Cardputer. This application turns your Cardputer into a pocket-sized music station with a graphical interface, audio visualizer, playlist management, and keyboard controls.✨ Features** Graphical User Interface:**Split-Screen Layout: Scrollable playlist on the left, "Now Playing" details on the right.Album Art / Metadata: Displays Song Title and Artist from ID3 tags.Progress Bar: Real-time seeking bar showing track progress.Audio Visualizer: FFT-based frequency bars that dance to the music (can be toggled to save battery).🎧 Advanced Playback Controls:Play/Pause/Stop: Standard media controls.Next/Previous: Skip tracks easily.Fast Forward / Rewind: Jump +/- 5 seconds using , and /.Shuffle Mode: Randomize your playlist.Loop Modes: Toggle between No Loop, Loop All, and Loop One.💾 Smart Library Management:Fast Startup: Scans the SD card once and caches the playlist to a file (playlist.txt). subsequent boots are instant.Recursive Scanning: Finds MP3s in root and subfolders.Rescan Option: Built-in menu to manually refresh the library if you add new songs.ℹ️ On-Device Help:Press I to open a scrollable Help popup listing all keyboard shortcuts.🛠️ Hardware RequirementsM5Stack Cardputer (ESP32-S3 based)MicroSD Card (Formatted to FAT32)MP3 Files📦 Software & LibrariesThis project is built using the Arduino IDE. You need to install the following libraries via the Arduino Library Manager:M5Cardputer (by M5Stack)M5Unified (by M5Stack)ESP8266Audio (by Earle F. Philhower, III) - Required for MP3 decoding.Note: No external JSON library is required. The caching system uses standard file I/O to keep dependencies light.🚀 InstallationPrepare the SD Card:Format your MicroSD card to FAT32.Copy your .mp3 files onto the card. You can place them in the root directory or organize them into folders.Insert the SD card into the Cardputer.Setup Arduino IDE:Open Arduino IDE.Go to Tools > Board and select M5Stack Cardputer (or M5Stack-STAMPS3 if Cardputer isn't listed, but ensure pin definitions match).Install the required libraries listed above.Flash the Code:Copy the source code into a new sketch.Connect your Cardputer via USB-C.Click Upload.🎮 ControlsKeyFunctionDescriptionPPlay / PauseToggle playback.NNext TrackSkip to the next song.BPrevious TrackGo back to the previous song.SShuffleToggle Shuffle mode On/Off.LLoop ModeCycle: 1X (No Loop) -> ALL (Loop All) -> ONE (Loop Song)./Fast ForwardJump forward 5 seconds.,RewindJump backward 5 seconds.;Vol Up / Scroll UpIncreases Volume.

❓ Troubleshooting"No MP3 Files Found":Ensure the SD card is FAT32.Ensure files end in .mp3.Try pressing M then 1 to force a rescan.Audio Stuttering:This can happen with very high bitrate files (320kbps+) or slow SD cards. The code is optimized for 128kbps - 192kbps MP3s.Compilation Errors:Ensure you have installed ESP8266Audio version 1.9.7 or later.📜 LicenseThis project is open-source. Feel free to modify and improve it!Credits:Audio processing powered by the ESP8266Audio Library.UI and Hardware integration via M5Stack libraries.
